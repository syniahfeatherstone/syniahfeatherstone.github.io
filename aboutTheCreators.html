      My name is Jasonnae, I'm 17 years old and an incoming Senior. As a young African American girl, I wanted to be apart of putting the website together. I want to help young girls of color. There have been times when I  experienced judgement because of the color of my skin. I did not let that discrimination stop me. I will stand with my head held high, and encourage others to do so. Over the summer, I was in Girls Who Code. It was a good experience to try something new. I'm an athlete so it felt kind of good to try something different from sports. I'm not necessarily a girly girl more of a tom boy. I prefer carmax over lip gloss.The basketball court is my bestfriend. Our website will cater to girls with varying interest. I prefer to shoot hoops over going out with friends. If  Contact me Email: Jasonnae11@gmail.com

        My name is Ayanna Johnson, I am a 16 year old highschool student currently going into my junior year. This summer I was in Girls Who Code and as a final project we created this website. I did this as a place for all girls of color to have a place to relate. I am a student athlete and enjoy working with people. My undertone is neutral and I enjoy highlighters way too much. For myself lipstick is never a big thing. For me I'll choose a gloss over a lipstick any day. I don't always get to wear makeup but for a everyday look I enjoy just a simple matting face look with a good amount of mascara. If I'm really excited I'll do a little shimmer on the eyes. I'm more of a sporty girl but I love skirts, puppies, and teen fiction if you would like to know more about me or contact me for questions you can add me on my social media account Instagram : 3.15.75 or email me ayannajohnson173@rusdlearns.net

     My name is Syniah Featherstone. I am 17 years old and a incoming senior. Divergent Girls Of Color means so much to me. I see far past my final project in Girls Who Code. I am grateful for the knowledge I have aquired and the help my teachers have given me. I am excited about the year I am about to embark on and look forward to taking these friends and skills with me. I never considered computer science before this summer and I am so glad I did. It has opened a whole new world for me. I learned I have the power to create and build. I can apply CS to any career. I want DGC to be a place girls can come to as a resource to connect with others. I want young women of color to be empowered and know they can change the world. I have a vision for merchandise to be sold, updates on fashion, ethnic news, makeup and hair hacks and much more. I want our users to feel safe in an enviroment made just for them. Away from the sterotypes and negativity DGC is a safe place. My contact info: syniahfeatherstone@gmail.com
