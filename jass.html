  My name is Ayanna Johnson, I am a 16 year old Highschool student currently going into my junior year. This summer I was in Girls Who Code and as a final project we created this website. I did this as a place for all girls of color to have a place to relate. I am a student athlete and enjoy working with people. My undertoutral and I enjoy highlighters way too much for myself lipstick is never a big thing for me I'll choose a gloss over a lipstick any day I don't always get to wear makeup but for a everyday look I enjoy just a simple matting face look with a good amount of mascara and if I'm really excited I'll do a little shimmer on the eyes I'm more of a sporty girl but I love skirts, puppies, and teen fiction if you would like to know more about me or contact me for questions you can add me on my social media account Instagram : 3.15.75 or email me ayannajohnson173@rusdlearns.net
